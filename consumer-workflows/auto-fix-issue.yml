# Workflow: Auto Fix Issue
# ======================================================================================
# Usage:
#   - Apply the label 'warp-agent' to any GitHub Issue.
#   - This workflow will trigger, analyze the issue, and attempt to write code to fix it.
#
# Setup:
#   - Ensure WARP_API_KEY is set in Repository Secrets.
#   - Ensure the Action has write permissions for contents, issues, and pull-requests.
#
# Expected Output:
#   - If a fix is found: A new Pull Request (fix/issue-NUMBER) is created and linked to the issue.
#   - If no fix is found: The Agent comments on the issue explaining why.
#
# When to use:
#   - Use this to delegate bug fixes, small features, or chore tasks to the Warp Agent.
